# TASK-020: Mastery Constellation Design

## Concept: Advanced Skill Trees
Branching paths that allow players to specialize their fighters beyond basic stats. 

## Style: Ethereal Iron
- Dark metallic textures (Iron)
- Glowing ethereal nodes (Blue/Purple/White)
- Branching connective lines with "spirit-flow" animations

## Focus Branches

*Focus: Physical damage, crits, and speed.*
- **Node: Iron Grip** (Prereq: Level 5) - +10% Attack Speed.
- **Node: Severing Strike** (Prereq: Level 15) - Crits apply Bleed (5% HP/sec).
- **End-Node: Blood-Iron Hurricane** - Every 4th attack hits all adjacent enemies for 200% damage.

*Focus: Sustaining team and tactical utility.*
- **Node: Ethereal Mend** (Prereq: Level 5) - Basic attacks heal lowest HP ally for 5%.
- **Node: Spirit Shield** (Prereq: Level 15) - Buffing an ally gives them a shield for 10% of their Max HP.
- **End-Node: Ascendance Pillar** - Upon death, fighter remains as an invulnerable spirit for 10s, healing all allies for 15% HP/sec.

### 3. Utility (The Forge Path)

- **Node: Heavy Impact** (Prereq: Level 5) - 10% chance to Stun on hit for 1s.
- **Node: Forge Smoke** (Prereq: Level 15) - Health drops below 30% create an evasion cloud (+50% Dodge).
