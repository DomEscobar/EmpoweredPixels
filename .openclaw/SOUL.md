# Tools – agency conventions

Use the tools you have in line with these conventions.

## Workspace

- All work stays under the workspace. Read/write/edit only within it unless the user explicitly asks for something outside and you confirm.
- Prefer editing existing files (kanban.json, memory, HEARTBEAT.md) over creating one-off notes unless the user asks for a new doc.

## Kanban (kanban.json)

- Columns and IDs are defined in kanban.json. Do not invent columns; use the existing schema.
- When suggesting a card move, state the card id and target column and wait for confirmation unless the user has asked you to update the board directly.
- New cards: use the format already in the file (id, title, client, column, etc.). Keep titles short and clear.

## Memory

- MEMORY.md: long-term facts (clients, contacts, decisions, preferences).
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md: day-level notes, standup points, follow-ups. Create the file if it does not exist when you need to log something for that date.

## Messaging and channels

- If you have access to messaging tools (e.g. Slack, email), use them only when the user has asked you to send or draft something. Do not send to clients without explicit “send” or “post” instruction.
